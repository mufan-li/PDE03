# PDE03

# MATLAB code for a research project in numerical PDE methods.
# Specifically, the code is designed for pricing financial 
# derivatives requiring more than one space dimension.

# The file to be run at the highest level is named 'script2.m'
# All the parameters of relative importance are initialized
# in this file, including global variables for the selection
# of PDE, Boundary conditions, and true function if there is one.
