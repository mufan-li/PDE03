Notes

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To do
 - keep track of free boundary
 - Margrabe/Spread BC

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Saturday July 25

Added Quadratic Penalty
 - need to guess ujk1 before solving
 - penalty convergence is poor

Large ~ 1/tol^2
 - caused more penalty iterations
 - oscillations did not improve

Added free boundary
 - Storing ucomp is costly, consider removing

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Tuesday July 21

Fully implicit stepping still causes oscillation

Test with given parameters
Number of iterations
Penalty term in stoch.vol. paper
 - squared term
 - Large ~ 1/tol^2

free boundary surface
adaptive grids - ccc
 - De Boor 1974
 - Grading function and mesh redistribution 1985

Heston Papers
 - formulation 
 	http://bfi.cl/papers/Mikhailov%20Nogel%202003%20-%20Heston's%20stochastic%20volatility%20Model%20implementation%20calibration%20and%20some%20extensions.pdf
 - implementation
 	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.02963v2.pdf

Added monotonic stepsize column
Added dnorm adjustment for OS/penalty comparison
Added same non-uniform grid in y-direction
 - centered at beta
Added onesided forward/backward convection discretization
 - did not help oscillation

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Tuesday July 14

Smoothing of 2nd derivatives
 - grid concentrated near beta
  - mid point at beta
 - convection terms forward/backward
  - forward x-dir
 - cross section

European solution

Adaptive time-steps
 - increasing
 - change dnorm for os to get comparable step sizes

Convergence for Greeks

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Monday July 13

OS
 - instability fixed by not applying at BC
 - consider keep for Neumann BC

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Saturday July 11

Non-uniform grid
 - reducing concentration in y eases instability
 - spike near (K,0) is related to d2
 - instability specific to OS
 - Uxx and Uyy oscillations remain

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Friday July 10

Margrabe/Spread
 - PDE condition at (xmax,ymax) is unstable
 - Need more information at BC

Zvan, Forsyth, Vetzal (1998)
 - used FEM

Adaptive time stepping
 - dnorm is difference for each option
 	- specifically Heston

Heston
 - Rannacher smoothing seems to have resolved
 	the rough edges near ymax
 - cond sensitive to non-uniform grid
 - non-uniform grid in y
 	- spike in uyy plot near x=K and y=0
 - together with non-uniform grid in x
 	- causes oscillation for OS at y=ymax
 	- over compensation
 - uxx plot takes questionalbe complex shape
 - adaptive time makes even more unstable

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Tuesday July 7

Test on different Smax and ymax, and other parameters
Compution time
 - const coefs/dirichlet BC
 - cond/norm if statements

Margrabe/Spread Call
 - bug in Margrabe
 - remove Dirichlet BC

Tests
 - deltas, gammas
 - adaptive time - element wise

Forsyth paper stochastic vol
Haentjens Heston paper

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Sunday July 5

Does reducing Smax actually affect error given Neumann BC?

Boundary problem
 - oscillation between convex up and convex down
 - uyy term over compensate at each time step

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Saturday July 4

Fixed several Neumann BC bugs
 - rhs oy vector
 - PDE 101 not triggered
 - penalty and splitting now only applied at PDE points

Rough edge remains near strike at y=ymax
 - seems as if it receives less diffusion in the x-dim
 - only near the strike
 - possibly causing discrepancy vs HaHo13 ADI results 
 	- HaHo13 had cut off at 150

Added cond and norm to summary

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Friday July 3

Implement Neumann BC for Heston Model

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Thursday July 2

Generalized PDE BC
 - added one-sided derivatives at BC

Margrabe solution may need additional BC information
 - could use y*u(x/y,K=1) to find ficticious points
 - probably not worth investigating

Spread call and put
 - bump near strike at x=max boundary
 - possibly similar to Margrabe type error
  - BC is more complex than Dirichlet and PDE
 - Error in MATLAB implementation as well

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Tuesday June 30

Margrabe
 - Using European as Dirichlet BC
 - Compare Euro and American errors

Spread Call
 - penalty iteration

PDE BC - in the Uxx direction at x=Smax

Neumann Uxy in the corner
 - 4 Neumann + PDE BC?
 - Maybe additional Neumann by taking d2g/dxy

Email student/library #

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Sunday June 28

One-sided discretization
 - correct but lower order
 - significantly worse magnitude of error in complex shapes

PDE BC Added for all BC types
 - American Margrabe still have issue at (Smax,Smax)

Operator splitting formula
 - no difference in computation results
 - norm of difference in uj1 is ~ 1e-25

Implementing Heston Model
 - PDEno=101, Rbno=[30 31], BCno=10

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Tuesday June 23

Added PDE type BC to some American options
 - only added at x=0 and y=0 boundaries except (0,0)
 - still requires dirichlet type BC
 - does not account for spread type options

One-sided discretization
 - order of error for smooth grid
 - effect of first order approx

Condition number with infinity norm
 - one for each step size
 - test rate of increase for larger grids

Norm of inverses

ADI Paper Operator Splitting
 - equation 15,21
 - test the difference
 - convergence to different values

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

check boundary conditions

adaptive time grids
 - compare

Neumann BC/PDE
 - BVPs first

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Tuesday June 16, 2015

Adaptive Time steps
 - improved computation costs, but not error

Consider adding tolerance to penalty

PDE Boundary Conditions

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Thursday June 10, 2015

Added dividends to American options
 - confirmed prices on max calls
 	- although PDE tends to over estimate slightly
 - max puts using MC paper still inconsistent

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Wedesnday June 9, 2015

Added dividends to European options
 - PDE and closed form solutions

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Tuesday June 8, 2015

Added class summary for displaying information
 - note fb is ignored for now as definition unclear
 - possibly look for fb in one direction fixing one axis

Issue when taking derivatives with BC
 - the points directly on BC is copied over
 - can only plot/interpolate points within calculated grids

Plots 
 - no obvious oscillations - although grids are small
 - gamma behave eratically towards x,y = 0 boundary

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Monday June 8, 2015

Changed implementation of matrices to include BC
 - BVPs are straight forward
 - IVPs require resetting the BC at each time step
 	- the BC does not need to be approximated

IVP no longer exact at x^2
 - errors are quite large

Fixed IVP bug
 - need to reformulate the linear problem
 - rhs also not handled properly
 - added b-vector for the BC and invertible Aim

New matrices now fully implemented and correct

 - calculate the actual price
 - discount to present value at risk-free
average at the end

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Friday May 29

Couldn't find reason for high convergence
 - (+/-) sign for Uxy affected convergence rates
 - Increasing magnitude also affected convergence rates

Bug in Margrabe option
 - EuroRb should be using t as tau
 - incorrect formula

Need to implement convergence for American types

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Implementing European Rainbow options problem
 - NaN in DirechletBC(), fixed by setting to zero

 - check notes from notebook

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Friday May 22

Fixed Ut term being time-dependent
 - code not supposed to handle coefficients on Ut
 - instead move coefficients to the other side

Test more cases for time-dep coefs
Frame code for BVPs - Tests 
 - or pull an earlier copy of the files

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Thursday May 21

Fixed bug for non-uniform grid at u=1, however not complete
 - still error for Ux and Uy terms
 - error found in rhs terms

Only change in exactness
Uxx+Uyy - x^3

Attempt to add IVP
 - exact cases are now correct
 - but observing low convergence rate
 	- error in truevd2()

Fixed bug
 - Ut term stops being exact at t^3

 Solution non-exact for time-dependent coefficients

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
