Monday June 8, 2015

Changed implementation of matrices to include BC
 - BVPs are straight forward
 - IVPs require resetting the BC at each time step
 	- the BC does not need to be approximated

IVP no longer exact at x^2
 - errors are quite large

Fixed IVP bug
 - need to reformulate the linear problem
 - rhs also not handled properly

Tuesday June 2

Confirmed that European Margrabe is correct with MATLAB
American Margrabe/Spread relatively consistent
Non-uniform grid have better results

More digits in results
number of steps in penalty
grid size for x,y
check values at different points near the strike
free boundary
delta/gamma
check for oscillations in price/greeks

check boundary conditions
dividend in PDE
 - exact solutions need dividends as well

adaptive time grids
 - compare

Neumann BC/PDE
 - BVPs first

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Monday June 1

added more American calls and puts
added penalty iteration and operator splitting
still need results to compare to

derived formulation for Neumann BC

for each MC path
 - need to simulate 2 random vectors
 - calculate the actual price
 - discount to present value at risk-free
average at the end

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Friday May 29

Couldn't find reason for high convergence
 - (+/-) sign for Uxy affected convergence rates
 - Increasing magnitude also affected convergence rates

Bug in Margrabe option
 - EuroRb should be using t as tau
 - incorrect formula

Need to implement convergence for American types

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Tuesday May 26

Check the ADI paper's publication
 - formula for IT and LCP

Neumann BC
 - test both ficticious point and one sided
 - forward for v=0
 - test assume linearity near Smax for ficticious point

Rainbow European
 - Stulz
 - Try discounted BC

Rainbow American
 - block penalty
 - operator splitting
 - convergence with itself
 - research papers
 - free boundary

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Monday May 25

Checked more complex functions for IVP

Implementing European Rainbow options problem
 - NaN in DirechletBC(), fixed by setting to zero

Consider working on Neumann BC, since referenced in paper
 - check notes from notebook

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Friday May 22

Fixed Ut term being time-dependent
 - code not supposed to handle coefficients on Ut
 - instead move coefficients to the other side

Test more cases for time-dep coefs
Frame code for BVPs - Tests 
 - or pull an earlier copy of the files

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Thursday May 21

Fixed bug for non-uniform grid at u=1, however not complete
 - still error for Ux and Uy terms
 - error found in rhs terms

Only change in exactness
Uxx+Uyy - x^3

Attempt to add IVP
 - exact cases are now correct
 - but observing low convergence rate
 	- error in truevd2()

Fixed bug
 - Ut term stops being exact at t^3

 Solution non-exact for time-dependent coefficients

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Wednesday May 20
Goals - Test variable coefficients, derive non-unif disc.

Ux, Uy convergence at order 4 instead of 16
Double check convergence for u(x,y)=sin(x*y)

Uniform grid with non-uniform code produce correct results
Debugging non-uniform grid for u=1 case
	error in forming the matrix using spdiags
	- compare code with previous cfd2.m

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Tuesday May 19
Goals - Test basic cases for uniform grid

Uxx+Uyy - x^4, x^4*y^3
Ux - x^3, x^3*y^2
Uy - y^3, x^2*y^3
Uxy - x^4, x^3*y^2

Higher Dimensions

Ikonen 2004
Ikonen 2009 - 2D + Stochastic Vol
Heston Method

2D PDE
 - including cross derivatives
 - variable coef
 - debug carefully
 - Dirichlet BC

Kroniger/Tensor Product of Matrices
 - right hand side of equation
 - sometimes 1 or 2 (3 for cross derivatives) terms

u = 1, x, x+y, x^2
pde = laplace, helmholtz, more complex
convergence

European Rainbow Options - Analytical solutions

Batch mode output
 - matlab script output
