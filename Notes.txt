Fixed bug for non-uniform grid at u=1, however not complete
 - still error for Ux and Uy terms
 - error found in rhs terms

Only change in exactness
Uxx+Uyy - x^3

Attempt to add IVP
 - debugged but observing low convergence rate

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Wednesday May 20
Goals - Test variable coefficients, derive non-unif disc.

Ux, Uy convergence at order 4 instead of 16
Double check convergence for u(x,y)=sin(x*y)

Uniform grid with non-uniform code produce correct results
Debugging non-uniform grid for u=1 case
	error in forming the matrix using spdiags
	- compare code with previous cfd2.m

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Tuesday May 19
Goals - Test basic cases for uniform grid

Uxx+Uyy - x^4, x^4*y^3
Ux - x^3, x^3*y^2
Uy - y^3, x^2*y^3
Uxy - x^4, x^3*y^2
